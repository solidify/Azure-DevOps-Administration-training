# Azure Environments

Azure Environments is an alternative to the old Deployment Groups feature, meant for deploying an application to a target machine in a way that is highly configurable, resource independent and offers a lot of functionality in tandem with Multistage Pipelines.

## Exercise 1: Create the environments

### Goal

The goal of this exercise is to create two Azure Environments from the Azure Portal, one for each deployment stage, as well as configure approvals between the two stages.

### Steps

#### Create the agent

1. In the Azure Devops portal, in the left-hand menu bar, navigate to *Pipelines* -> *Environments*. Click Create Environment. Choose **Virtual Machines**. Name the Environment "myproject-test". Leave the default Provider and OS.
2. Under "Registration script", copy the code snippet and run it in an Administrator Powershell window. This will install the agent and configure it. Afterwards you should see the agent in the portal.
3. Create another environment named "my-project-prod" and install an agent using the same process. You should now have two environments with one agent each.

#### Create the variable groups

Each agent needs a variable group with identical fields, if we are going to use a data driven deployment model.

4. In the left-hand menu bar, navigate to *Pipelines* -> *Library*.
5. Create two variable groups, one named "my-project-vars-test" and another named "my-project-vars-prod". Add a variable called "text_to_print" to both, and give them some unique (different) values.

#### Set up the approval process

We need an approval process to minimize the risk that we deploy non produciton-ready code to the prod environment.

6. Under *Environments*, click the prod environment. Click the top-right "More actions" button, and click *Approvals and checks*.
7. Add a new approval. Add yourself as the only approver.

### Review

We have just created an Azure Environment for every stage in our deployment lifecycle. We created separate variable groups and set up an approval process.
